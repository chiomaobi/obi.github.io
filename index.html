  <h2>Why Did we Create Youth Volunteer</h2>
</em>
</center>

  <p>	Youth Volunteer is a oraganization that provides service and support for many people who need help around the world.
    We believe that it is important for everyone to help out people in need. We love helping
    people amd seeing their lives change. We know that finding places to volunteer gets really hard sometimes, especially
    finding a place where you would enjoy your time.
    So that is why we created this website to make it the easiest way possible
    to find the physical and social benefits of volunteering. This organization allows young folks all
    around the world to get together and start volunteering at a young age. </p>
    <center>

    <h2>How Does it Work</h2>
      </em>
  </center>
  <p>		On our map tab there is a map, you'll input the city or zip
    you would like to volunteer in, a list will pop up of the nearest
    volunteer centers will be listed as well as their contact informaton. You can volunteer anywhere around the world.</p>

  <h2>Why You Should Volunteer</h2>
      </em>
    </center>

  <p>  Aside from probably completing your mandatory school
    service hours, volunteering has many benefits such as meeting new people,
    feeling more involved in your community, building new connections, and
    learning something new each day. We encourage everyone to volunteer some point in their life because
    it can change someones life, even if it is not much. </p>

<h3>Who is your Greatest Inspiration and Why?</h3>
  <h4>Chioma</h4>
  <p>God and my family.God would of course always and forever be my inspiration. I trust in Him and I know that I don't have to worry
    because He's here with me always.
    I go to my family for everything and they are the ones that I can really trust.</p>
  <h4>Natalia</h4>
  <p>My parents would have to be my greatest inspiration, they always motivate
   me to do the best that I can do and<p>
  <h4>Areli</h4>
  <p>My inspirations are those who continue to be who they are, despite the world not approving, wanting, and accepting them. And those that continue to try, despite their number of fails.</p>

  <h3>What are your top 3 goals in Life?</h3>
  <h4>Chioma</h4>
<p>Always put God first, Prioritize my life, and Live in the moment</p>
  <h4>Natalia</h4>
  <p>Create my own philanthropy, become executive of a fortune 500 company and live a happy life.</p>
  <h4>Areli</h4>
  <p>To influence the world through my writing and films, create a multi-million dollar company with my family, and for my thinking, to keep evolving.</p>


  <h3>What is your favorite part about coding?</h3>
  <h4>Chioma</h4>
  <p> Before, I didn't know what coding was, but now that I've experienced how it's used and what it is, I've become very interested in it. Coding to me is changing a website that started out plain to having many abstracts of colors and style.
    It's amazing that coding can be used for almost anytype of job.
  <h4>Natalia</h4>
  <p>Being able to create whatever I desire, with just the tips of my fingers.</p>
  <h4>Areli</h4>
  <p>My code determines how it thinks and it's cool..also insane, that I have this control by just pressing a few symbols.</p>

<div id="Travel" class="tabcontent">
  <p> We included a travel option because we want everyone to experience other cultures while they volunteer. This wonderful journey of changing lives will take place every summer when students are out of school.
    We will provide scholarships and stipeneds for the volunteers that want to travel to another country.</p>

  <h3>Why it's important  to volunteer while traveling</h3>
 <p>We believe it is important, because it is a great
   opportunity to meet new people, experience new things
   and get to see the world while helping.</p><p> Sometimes in life, we forget about the little things around us and  sometimes we don't stop to think about what's really important.</p>
 <p>Their are many problems that have happened in this world and still today things are happening.</p> <p>The great thing about traveling around the world is that you have the
opportunity to save many lives.</p> <p>There are people in Africa, Asia, and everywhere else that need our help. Lets let today be the day that we help someone, whether it's giving
them food or a roof to live under, either one will be life changing for them.</p>

 <h3>Reviews</h3>
 <p>These statements belong to VolunteerForever</p>
 <p><em>The work programme itself was varied and enjoyable. Some
   physical work involving chopping down bushes, trees etc and
   planting, but mainly it was data monitoring of animals and
   their behaviour. In my time there I learned so much about
   each animal type and their behaviour.- Anonymous</em></p>
 <p><em>You get to work with so many different people and really
   see the impact you are having in their lives, both through
   your chosen project and for the extra time spent reading
   with a child or playing sports. On top of the volunteering,
   you get to experience and learn about the Zambian culture
   as well as explore the country, for example, by going on
   safari or doing a bridge swing over Victoria Falls.

 <p><em>Peru is so beautiful. There are so many historical
   buildings and ruins, you could spend weeks there just
   exploring it all. Volunteering at the after school program
   was a lot of fun. The kids were so sweet and eager to learn.
   Also, my Spanish classes were very fun and my understanding
   of the language improved greatly. Machu Picchu is also a must
   and I recommend taking the train there because the scenery is
   breath taking. I enjoyed every single minute and would
   definitely return! -Anonymous</em></p>
